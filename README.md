## ExternalFIleSorting
This project implements an external sorting algorithm using large buffers to efficiently handle datasets that exceed available RAM. 
It simulates real-world scenarios where data must be sorted while optimizing disk I/O operations. 
The program generates records, sorts them in phases using buffer-based merging, and analyzes performance metrics, comparing theoretical and practical results.
